how to test 2fa?

first do normal authentication. 

add 2fa to frontend
get a nice view of the database

add username endpoint

when you do
  app.enableCors({
	  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
    credentials: true,

then Access-Control-Allow-Credentials should be set,
but in the network tab of the browser debugger it doesn't seem to be set, and it says 'CORS No Allow Credentials'
