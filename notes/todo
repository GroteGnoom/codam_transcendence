When starting up on a new computer, the pg_hba.conf is not set correctly (for every computer), so it could be that 0.0.0.0/0 is missing, and you'll get 
 error: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "172.18.0.4", user "postgres", database "transcendence_db", no encryption
 ..and also other problems, for which the proper solution is to delete all postgres_data
