flow:
user authentication -> set username page -> create user
when clicked on my account -> user already exists -> set account properties

TODOS
[V] randomness random name generator: fetch if user already exists? and max length check
[ ] better validation checks; only all the user input; check type and not empty! (depending on the type of request probably?) (2fa code, image, username)
[V] severity error 2fa wrong to error!
[V] signup doesn't work? either or signup.tsx or signup: true
curl -X POST http://f1r1s16.codam.nl:5000/users/create -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "bla", "intraname": "ta"}'
curl -X POST http://f1r1s16.codam.nl:5000/users/avatar -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "bla"}'
curl -X PUT http://f1r1s16.codam.nl:5000/users/block/bla
curl -X PUT http://f1r1s16.codam.nl:5000/users/updateuser -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{"isTfaEnabled": true, "username": "1234"}'
[ ] whenever accepting a parameter as number, check this
[ ] userinfo: alles in frontend aanpassen (catch nu helemaal geen errors in userinfo, of if statements)
[ ] delete functions not needed
[ ] save secret only when save user, not when qr code created

[ ] add useguard to all endpoints
[ ] password error channels
[V] open leaderboard: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id') in leaderboard.tsx:64
the backend should not send sensitive userdata about other users

maybe(if all the important things are done):
not allow a player to be in multiple games at once?
you should not be able to block yourself in chat

if you first have tfa turned on, and then turn it off and on, your secret is changed, but you weren't asked to check it, so now you don't have the proper codes on your google authenticator.

at the end, just before evals:
- use production server, not develop
- everything should work with
  docker-compose up --build
  not via a makefile
- do TODO's in the code (do find TODO in vscode, or grep for TODO) including the fake login. Very important.
- delete signout button

important forever:
every Post and Put should not cause a 500, even with random input. All `save` and `find`, which query the database need to have a catch and throw bad request


all checks user validation:
[ ] for every put/post
[ ] since user can only put trash in db with update/save, always catch error when update/save + throw
[ ] this throw must be catched every time the function is called
[ ] besides, check when functions are called which have update/save method
