When starting up on a new computer, the pg_hba.conf is not set correctly (for every computer), so it could be that 0.0.0.0/0 is missing, and you'll get 
 error: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "172.18.0.4", user "postgres", database "transcendence_db", no encryption
 ..and also other problems, for which the proper solution is to delete all postgres_data

flow:
user authentication -> set username page -> create user
when clicked on my account -> user already exists -> set account properties

TODOS
[ ] make loggin websocket
[ ] randomness random name generator: fetch if user already exists? and max length check
[ ] better validation checks; only all the user input; check type and not empty! (depending on the type of request probably?)
curl -X POST http://f1r1s16.codam.nl:3000/users/create -H "Content-Type: application/json -d '{"username": "dfjklsdfjldsfldjsfkdlsfjdklsfds", "intraname": "tatatatatatatatataaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}'
at the end, just before evals:
- use production server, not develop
- everything should work with
  docker-compose up --build
  not via a makefile
