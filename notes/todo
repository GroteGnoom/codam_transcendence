[V] user account pagina:
[V] set username
[V] check ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE; send custom response when username not unique?
[V] show intraName; fix 401 error request
[ ] better unique username checker; custom validator
[V] add icon for custom avatar upload
[ ] save custom avatar in db
[ ] when signed up, redirect to homepage and show buttons
[ ] make account page

flow:
user authentication -> set username page -> create user
when clicked on my account -> user already exists -> set account properties
