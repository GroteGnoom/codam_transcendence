to encrypt the nestjs .env file
we're using 
https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt
which can be installed with
brew install git-crypt

to unlock it you need a key :)

then do 
git-crypt unlock /path/to/key
and everything should work correctly forever.

to check what files are encrypted you can do
git-crypt status
